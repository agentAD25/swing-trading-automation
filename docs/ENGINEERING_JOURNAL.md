Append-only record of material repository work. Correct prior entries with a
new entry rather than rewriting history.

## 2026-09-25 — Phase 1A governance bootstrap

### Scope

Established repository structure, agent authority, mandatory rules, four agent
roles, decision records, research handoff requirements, and factual current
state. No TradeStation research or foundation implementation was performed.

### Starting evidence

- `git fetch origin main` completed successfully.
- Canonical `origin/main` was commit `8b37e20` (`Add new Test file`).
- `git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main` returned only `Test`.
- Existing `Test` content was the single line `Test`; it was preserved.

### Decisions and boundaries

- `SIM` is the sole authorized execution mode.
- `LIVE`, real-account interaction, credentials, and real-capital deployment
  are unauthorized.
- Three research workstreams are scoped as broker/API, strategy/data, and
  risk/operations.
- Durable architecture decisions require human acceptance of an ADR.

### Unresolved

- Broker and market-data requirements are not researched.
- Strategy, universe, timeframe, and data requirements are not selected.
- Risk limits, operating controls, and compliance obligations are not selected.
- Technology stack, package layout, deployment target, and test tooling are
  not selected.
- Human owners/deciders and criteria for later phase transitions are not named.

### Validation

Pending at the time of this entry; exact commands and outcomes will be added
before Phase 1A is handed off.
